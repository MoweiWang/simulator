YAPS = Yet Another Packet Simulator
==================================

![Our Project Mascot](yaps-mascot.png)

* core stuff is in `core/`. Normally this shouldn't change
* extensions are in `ext/`. This is where you implement your favorite protocol.
* stuff related to actually running the simulator is in `run/`.
